### WebAssembly from C/Cpp


This is a simple code to implement yin pitch detector, it is based on the code of [ashokfernandez](https://github.com/ashokfernandez/Yin-Pitch-Tracking) and [JorenSix](https://github.com/JorenSix/Pidato) and all the recent forks and updates (2023) from [ashokfernandez](https://github.com/ashokfernandez/Yin-Pitch-Tracking).



### License

The software is licensed under the GPL since the Yin code is based on the GPLâ€™d TarsosDSP java implementation which is in turn based on the aubio implementation in c by Paul Brossier, also under the GPL.
